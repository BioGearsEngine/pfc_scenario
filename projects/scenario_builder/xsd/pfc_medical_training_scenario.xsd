				Document Training Event used to describe each step in the training narrative. In my mind these will be labeled with a fedelity level that decides how in the weeds the event is. Virtual simulations would be interested in very low fedelity entriies while medical simulations cripts would be interested in high level events. In addition we could divide events in to Dialog,Movment,Action,Accoustics,Enviromental.  This part still needs some fleshing out and is a little wavey. 

				Example
					Action : Low Fedility : Cast members X Y Z appear at location X
					Sound  : Medium Fedelity : Gun Shot Noise
					Action : Low Fedility : Cast member X is shot and sustains Hemmorage Injury in his shoulder
					Dialog : Low Fedeility: : X Says " Aww Crap"
					Movment: High Fedelity :Y and Z converge on X
					Dialog : Medium Fedeility: : Y Says " You got Shot"
					Dialog : Medium Fedeility: : X Says " I got Shot"
					Action : Low Fedeility: : Y and Z take X to Base Camp
					End Scene:
